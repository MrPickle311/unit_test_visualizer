# Unit Test Visualizer

This is application which has two main purposes:
- provides serial terminal for one or more devices
- visualizes results of unit tests carried out on the microcontroller

# General Information

This appplication is divided on two modules( separate windows )

### Terminal module

Terminal module is able to show and send data from several devices.
Incoming data may be shown as ASCII , decimal , binary or hexadecimal.
Data may be sent as ASCII characters or unsigned numbers in the 
following formats:

Graphical results contains test cases and its names . In test cases 
are embedded unit tests results. Green color indicates that test 
is passed , red indicates test failure.
