# Unit Test Visualizer

This is application which has two main purposes:
- provides serial terminal for one or more devices
- visualizes results of unit tests carried out on the microcontroller

# General Information

This appplication is divided on two modules( separate windows )

### Terminal module

Terminal module is able to show and send data from several devices.
Incoming data may be shown as ASCII , decimal , binary or hexadecimal.
Data may be sent as ASCII characters or unsigned numbers in the 
following formats:
- uint8
- uint16
- uint32
- uint64

### Tests module

Tests module is able to present the results of unit tests as a lists.
Graphical results contains test cases and its names . In test cases 
are embedded unit tests results. Green color indicates that test 
is passed , red indicates test failure.

#### Warning!

By default this project is configured with implementation ( see technical description )
which uses MCU unit test library from this  
[repository](https://github.com/MrPickle311/MCU_testing_library)

# Technologies Used
- C++17

# Usage

### Terminal module

After opening this application you must setup port by clicking setup icon.

In the left corner you can choose for which module you want to setup port.

At first you have to rescan for avalaible ports.

And now you can customize your port settings and click apply to create port entry.

Your port is ready , so go to the terminal module

and click Open port.

And now if you want you can add more ports.

### Tests module 

Configuration is very similar to terminal configuration , but you choose
device on which the tests are carried out.

Now you will see empty window. To pull tests results just click refresh
button.

After this tests results are loaded here.
